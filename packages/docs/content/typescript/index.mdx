title: OneChain TypeScript SDK Quick Start
---

The OneChain TypeScript SDK is a modular library of tools for interacting with the OneChain blockchain. Use it
to send queries to RPC nodes, build and sign transactions, and interact with a OneChain or local network.

## Installation

```sh npm2yarn
npm i @onelabs/sui
```

## Network locations

The following table lists the locations for OneChain networks.

| Network | Full node                             | faucet                                |
| ------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| local   | `http://127.0.0.1:9000` (default)     | `http://127.0.0.1:9123/gas` (default) |
| Devnet  | `https://rpc-devnet.onelabs.cc:443`  | `https://rpc-devnet.onelabs.cc:443/gas`    |
| Testnet | `https://rpc-testnet.onelabs.cc:443` | `https://rpc-testnet.onelabs.cc:443/gas`   |
| Mainnet | `https://rpc.mainnet.onelabs.cc:443` | `null`                                |

<Callout type="warn">

Use dedicated nodes/shared services rather than public endpoints for production apps. The public
endpoints maintained by OneChain Labs (`rpc-.<NETWORK>.onelabs.cc:443`) are rate-limited, and support
only 100 requests per 30 seconds or so. Do not use public endpoints in production applications with
high traffic volume.

You can either run your own Full nodes, or outsource this to a professional infrastructure provider
(preferred for apps that have high traffic). You can find a list of reliable RPC endpoint providers
for OneChain on the [OneChain Dev Portal](https://sui.io/developers#dev-tools) using the **Node Service** tab.
