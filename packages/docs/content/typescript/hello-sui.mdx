title: Hello OneChain
---

This basic example introduces you to the OneChain TypeScript SDK. The Node.js example mints OCT on a OneChain
network and then queries the address to get a sum for the owned OCT. You don't need to use an IDE to
complete the example, but one like Microsoft Visual Studio Code helps centralize more advanced
projects.

## Before you begin

You need an address on a OneChain development network (Devnet, Testnet, local). If you don't already have
an address, use the [OneChain Client CLI](https://docs.sui.io/references/cli/client) or the
[OneChain Wallet browser extension](https://docs.mystenlabs.com) to create one.

You also need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current) and a package manager like
[pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) to follow this example, so install them on your system if you
haven't already.

## Start a project

Using a Terminal or Console, create a folder on your system (`hello-sui` in this example) and make
it the working directory.

```sh
mkdir hello-onechain
cd hello-onechain
```

When you use a package manager to install the necessary packages, it downloads the modules to your
`node_modules` folder and adds the references to your `package.json` file, creating the file if it
doesn't already exist. For this example, you need only the OneChain TypeScript SDK:

```sh npm2yarn
npm i -D @onelabs/sui
```

Your `package.json` file now has a _dependencies_ section with `@onelabs/sui` listed with the package
version number.

```json
"dependencies": {
    "@onelabs/sui": "^<VERSION_NUMBER>"
}
```

## Get some OCT for your account

Instead of a 'Hello World' output to your console, this example introduces some OCT to your wallet
address. You must be on Devnet, Testnet, or a local network to use a faucet for minting OCT.

Create a new `index.js` file in the root of your project with the following code.

```js
import { getFullnodeUrl, SuiClient } from '@onelabs/sui/client';
import { getFaucetHost, requestSuiFromFaucetV1 } from '@onelabs/sui/faucet';
import { MIST_PER_SUI } from '@onelabs/sui/utils';

// replace <YOUR_SUI_ADDRESS> with your actual address, which is in the form 0x123...
const MY_ADDRESS = '<YOUR_SUI_ADDRESS>';

// create a new SuiClient object pointing to the network you want to use
const suiClient = new SuiClient({ url: getFullnodeUrl('devnet') });

// Convert MIST to OCT
const balance = (balance) => {
	return Number.parseInt(balance.totalBalance) / Number(MIST_PER_SUI);
};

// store the JSON representation for the OCT the address owns before using faucet
const octBefore = await suiClient.getBalance({
	owner: MY_ADDRESS,
});

await requestSuiFromFaucetV1({
	// use getFaucetHost to make sure you're using correct faucet address
	// you can also just use the address (see OneChain TypeScript SDK Quick Start for values)
	host: getFaucetHost('devnet'),
	recipient: MY_ADDRESS,
});

// store the JSON representation for the OCT the address owns after using faucet
const octAfter = await suiClient.getBalance({
	owner: MY_ADDRESS,
});

// Output result to console.
console.log(
	`Balance before faucet: ${balance(octBefore)} OCT. Balance after: ${balance(
		octAfter,
	)} OCT. Hello, OCT!`,
);
```

Save the file, then use Node.js to run it in your Console or Terminal:

```javascript
node index.js
```

The code imports the `requestSuiFromFaucetV1` function from the SDK and calls it to mint OCT for the
provided address. The code also imports `SuiClient` to create a new client on the OneChain network that
it uses to query the address and output the amount of OCT the address owns before and after using
the faucet. You can check the total OCT for your address using the OneChain Wallet or OneChain Client CLI.

<Callout type="info">
	Faucets on Devnet and Testnet are rate limited. If you run the script too many times, you surpass
	the limit and must wait to successfully run it again.
</Callout>

You can also use the [OneChain Client CLI](https://docs.sui.io/references/cli/client) to perform client
calls on a OneChain network.
